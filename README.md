Everything complied 2/19/15

Need an image for each ship

# UPDATE 2/22/15 @1:33
I worked on a placement method, and cretaed a method that creates the grid full of 'e's. We need
to work the user input for placement, which there is a basic method for. Right now we are using a wonderful black
box for a ship placeholder. I will be at robotics until 7:30 but I am will to work after that tonight. If you ever have any questions however, I will have my phone with me. We also need to make a method for choosing what grid is being referenced by which method. That is all.
