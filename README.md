I finished the placement method I had made and deleted yours. Lots of check and set methods. Placement almost done. Had to take a break b/c brain overheated. Soon just visuals, and two player. IDK if we want to create AI or if we want to go down the path of two player. I have a good idea of how to create the AI but there is one small glitch I need to get rid of to make it less predicatable. Will get back on tonight, hopefully we can work on it together.
